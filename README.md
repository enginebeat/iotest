Raspi (Raspberry pi 3 B+) ioTest

My attempt at getting the Raspberry pi 3 B+ to work as a webserver.
-It has a button to turn on pin 7 on the raspberry pi which I attached an LED.
it worked fine but theLED will not stay on after I turned it on. Will check on a 2 B to see if the issue is compatability with the new raspi model.
